# HashForge: Building Hash Functions from Scratch

![Animated HashForge Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.gif)

Welcome to **HashForge**! This repository is dedicated to the exploration, development, and optimization of hash functions, implemented entirely in Python. Whether you're diving into cryptographic concepts, experimenting with collision resistance, or just curious about how hashes work at a low level, you've come to the right place. 

## Features
- **Custom Hash Functions**: Implementing hashing from the ground up.
- **Optimization**: Improving efficiency and security.
- **Collision Resistance Testing**: Evaluating function robustness.
- **Comparison & Benchmarking**: Against standard hashing algorithms.
- **Cryptographic Exploration**: Understanding security implications.
