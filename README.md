# HashForge: Learn Hashing, Security, and Cryptography by Building

![HashForge Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.gif)

**HashForge** is a practical, project-based cryptography lab that teaches you core security concepts through real implementations. You'll start with basic hashing and level up to building secure systems, breaking weak algorithms, and simulating real-world applications like password managers and blockchains.


## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How hashing algorithms work and what makes them secure
- Techniques like salting, HMAC, and key stretching
- File integrity verification, password storage, and message authentication
- Digital signatures and data encryption using modern standards
- How to simulate blockchains, secure chat systems, and authentication flows
- Recognizing and exploiting weaknesses in outdated hash functions


## 🔨 Hands-On Projects

> HashForge is organized as a series of themed mini-projects with increasing complexity.

- **Hash Basics** – Password hashing, file checksums, SHA & MD5 usage
- **Security Essentials** – Salting, HMAC, bcrypt/scrypt, timing attack defense
- **Applications** – Password manager, secure messaging, digital signatures
- **Blockchain** – Build a proof-of-work system and understand how blocks get linked
- **Cryptanalysis** – Simulate hash collisions and brute-force attacks on MD5/SHA-1
- **Encryption + Hashing** – Combine AES with HMAC for secure data storage
